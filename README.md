# Java Swing Calculator

This is a calculator app built using Java Swing.  
It was my first time working with Swing, GUIs, and event listeners in Java.
## About

At the time of creating this project, I wasn't aware of any other technologies for building GUIs in Java, so I decided to dive deep into Swing. I ended up overcomplicating the UI code, but I managed to make the calculator look pretty good! The project features custom rounded buttons and a modern interface, all built from scratch using only the standard Swing library.

## Features

- Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
- Custom rounded buttons for a modern look
- Keyboard input support (not fully finished)
- Responsive UI with button press effects

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Java installed.
2. Compile the source files:
    ```sh
    javac -d bin src/*.java
    ```
3. Run the app:
    ```sh
    java -cp bin CalculatorApp
